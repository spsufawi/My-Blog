<p>I have been doubting the necessity of installing anti-virus software these years. However, I used to have a hard time fighting the virus and malware on my computer. I remember that about 13 years ago which was 2005, my computer got virus really frequently given the fact I was not even checking those kind of websites(You know what I mean). The malware at that time was so common that once my internet explorer had 4, 5 toolbars. The Rising anti-virus was basically useless as well as its firewall. What’s more, the lenovo recovery cd even got virus.</p>
<p>We spent 50 RMB asking someone to help us fix the computer. He took one CD from the cd case and put it into the cd drive. I believe what he did was still reinstalling the system. Then he downloaded an anti-virus software that I can even remember the name now. It is called 北信源. I checked the software name for the first time in my life which was just now. It is even an IPO company. I did not get virus since that time. I don’t know if the reason was the software. Since that time, I never get any severe virus problem especially after I updated the system to window 7. The only time I actually paid for anti-virus software was in high school. I spent hundred of RMB on Nod32.</p>
<p>These years I am still using nod32 but just its trial version. If it was going to expire, I just searched a key online. Sometimes it was not easy to find. The nod32 on my current laptop expired long time ago and I could not even open it or delete it. I checked online and found it was <a href="https://support.eset.com/kb2289/">quite complicated</a>. I thought maybe I could just download a new one. This time, I decided to actually buy one. It was 60 dollars which was not cheap(Norton is only 40). However, the money can buy time in this case. I no longer need to search for keys. I downloade it and it failed to install. The problem was not the key but because the original nod32 on my laptop. I could not solve the problem so I just use the key for the nod32 on my old laptop. It made me quite irritated.</p>
<p>The reason that I want to have an anti-virus software on my laptop is that I am a person who usually worries too much. For example, even when I locked the outside door, I still went back to check if the fridge door was closed or if the water faucet was on.</p>
<p>Now I only got the infamous 360 installed on my laptop. I plan to buy Norton as I don’t want to spend any more time on it. I forcefully deleted Nod32 using 360. I felt like I am like a newbie when I failed to install or delete given the fact I have been using computer for 17 years. Are you a CS major? Can you repair my computer?</p>
<p>But I did not buy Norton, I felt that I already spent 60 dollars and don’t want pay another 40 today. I told myself I will buy it next days. Then I start worrying again that my laptop will get virus. Money was meant to be spent. Sometimes you just cannot change your not wise thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>It is never an honor thing to use the paid software freely. It is understandable if you are a student and don’t have much money. But I suggest to respect people’s work and start paying once you work.</strong></p>
